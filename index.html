            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>
              The challenge was to change the design of the website in order to
              increase lead generation and site traffic. American Warehouses
              wanted potential clients to know of the complex logistical
              capabilities they were capable of.

            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>
              Our solution was to update the design to show clients that the
              company was reliable, and didn’t fall behind modern times by
              having a strong online presence.
